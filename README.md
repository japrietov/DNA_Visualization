# DNA Visualization #
------ 
## Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Visual computing ##

This is the supplementary material for __"DNA Visualization using the Codeword Design problem"__. The project is done in [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) and presented in a [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

### Dependencies ###
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/): The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

`python -m pip install --user jupyter`

- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/): Is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/): Is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
 
`python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy nose`

- [Biopython](http://biopython.org/): Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python by an international team of developers.

`python -m pip install --user biopython`


### How to run: ###
To improve the visualization of the notebook, [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) was used to render it.
